# Mitochondrial-ORFans

This GitHub repository serves as a resource for the scripts and data utilized in the research article titled "ORFans in Mitochondrial Genomes of Marine Polychaete Polydora."

We have sequenced and analyzed the mitochondrial genome of Polydora cf. ciliata, a marine polychaete worm, we have also analysed the mitochondrial genomes of related taxa. During our investigation, we discovered regions that do not resemble standard metazoan mitochondrial DNA genes but lack stop codons in one of the reading frames  in several related species, we refer to these regions as "ORFans.” Our study also includes the analysis of the phylogeny of the newly sequenced Polydora cf. ciliata, a detailed examination of ORFan regions, and various other aspects related to this research.
